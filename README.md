Implement the methods of quick sorting and sorting by merge for an integer array (project type Class Library). Test the work of methods using the test framework MS Tests.


Implement the FilterDigit method that takes an array of integers and filters it so that only numbers containing the specified digit remain on the output (LINQ requests do not use!) For example, for the number 7, FilterDigit (7,1,2,3,4, 5,6,7,68,69,70, 15,17) -> {7, 7, 70, 17}. Develop unit tests (NUnit and MS Unit Test (including the DDT approach)) for testing the method.
